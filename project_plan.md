# Project Plan

## Description

My project involves creating an automated XP farm and factory in Minecraft using Computercraft scripts. The aim is to assist players in survival mode by efficiently collecting experience points and automating certain processes such as breeding and killing mobs, producing items, and securing locations with advanced security systems.

## Features

### Automatic XP farm/grinder

- Players can collect experience points by killing mobs that are automatically spawned and killed.
- Turtles are used to detect, attack, and collect items from mobs.
- Automatic collection and storage of items in chests.

### Secure access control

- Access to certain locations (such as the factory and slaughterhouse) is secured with a password that must be entered via a floppy disk.

### turtlevator with password protection

- Players can use an turtlevator to move to different floors, requiring a password to operate. Using turtles as elevators was far more simpler than building an entire elevator or having to download a mod. [my personal preference]

### Raphael OS

- A simple operating system based on Computercraft called Raphael OS, providing access to various functions and information.
- Includes a welcome screen, menu navigation with touchscreen buttons where you can view personal files and locations, and a self-destruct function (for fun).

## Impact

My project can help other players in the Minecraft community by providing them with:

- A more efficient way to collect experience points and produce items.
- An example of secure security for their own projects.
- Inspiration for creating complex automation systems in Minecraft.

## Scope

### What my project will do

- Create an automated XP farm and factory (already build if you use my world...or you can build your own farm/factory).
- Implement secure security mechanisms.
- Build a simple operating system for navigation and interaction (Could 100% be improved if you wanted to).

### What my project will not do

- Provide extensive graphical user interfaces (limited to textual interaction).
- Implement deep networking functionality.
- Build a full-fledged operating system with multiple users and permissions.

## Estimated Time Allocation

- Implementation of the XP farm and factory: 2 weeks.
- Development of security features: 1 day.
- Construction of the operating system: 3 days.

(It wasn't suppose take this long but wasted a lot time reading docs and watching tutorial videos on youtube..... (┬┬﹏┬┬) ).
