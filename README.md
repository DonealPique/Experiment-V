# How to Run the Project

**Read the project plan first!!**

## Download and Install Minecraft

- Ensure you have Minecraft installed on your computer.

## Set up Computercraft Mod

- Install the Computercraft mod in your Minecraft installation.
- Follow the mod installation instructions provided by the mod developer. You'll need CC.Tweaked in order to have access to computers to run scripts.

## Run the Scripts

1. In Minecraft, place down the necessary Computercraft turtles or computers.
2. Open the Computercraft interface on each turtle or computer.
3. Use the following command to download and execute the main script (e.g., `install.lua`) directly from the project repository on GitHub:

- wget run `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DonealPique/Experiment-V/main/scripts/install.lua`

This command will automatically download and run the `install.lua` script from the specified URL. **[Bonus]** My world will also be included in the download. Make sure to extracted zip file and use windows + R command and run this `%appdata%`. Once you've done that it'll bring you to the directory where Minecraft is located. Navigate through `.minecraft` to find saves and copy the extracted world folder and place it in saves. It should work if done correctly.
